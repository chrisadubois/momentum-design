# Scratch Documentation

We do not have a documentation reference site that can live as our source of truth. We know that we want our code, designs, and everything that lives in the repository to be the representation of our work, and serve as the documentation for our work. We will primarily be surfacing markdown files onto the site as static, handwritten documentation in addition to this. To that end, documentation that we produce in the interim should be put in the scratch folder until we have our documentation reference site set up. There are four folders to enter this into, explained below.

## Assets
Put static images and svg files here that can be referenced and used

## Design
Put documentation related to design philosophies, and decisions as markdown files here

## Engineering
Put documentation related to engineering as markdown files here

## Product
Put documentation related to product specifics here. Things such as webex specific documentation, web client, online, etc
